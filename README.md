## Example

#### DevSecops checking of a specific application

```
./veracode-cli -user '<API_KEY>' -pass '<API_SECRET>' -command 'devsecopscheck' -appname '<Application Profile Name>' -buildname <build name>
```

If the application has some none-mitigated flaws with high severity

```
2020/03/10 03:20:29 Veracode CLI version 1.1.0
2020/03/10 03:20:29 DevSecopscheck
2020/03/10 03:20:29 Finding App ID
2020/03/10 03:20:31 App ID:  *****
2020/03/10 03:20:31 Requesting build list
2020/03/10 03:20:31 Build ID:  *****
2020/03/10 03:20:31 Requesting build info
2020/03/10 03:20:32 The build status is [Results Ready]
2020/03/10 03:20:32 Requesting full report
2020/03/10 03:20:35 [Result] { High & V.High: 0 , Medium: 3 }
2020/03/10 03:20:35 [Error] The build has some none-mitigated flaws with high severity!
```

#### Checking Application status.

```
./veracode-cli -user '<API_KEY>' -pass '<API_SECRET>' -command 'buildstatus' -appname '<Application Profile Name>'
```

The latest build will be deleted if the status is incomplete

```

2020/02/03 06:33:01 Checking Build status
2020/02/03 06:33:01 Finding App ID
